See a full description on this [blog post](http://blog.trello.com/give-team-meetings-status-update/)  When you’re thinking about putting something on here:  * Shipping things is cool. Tell us all about it. * Is it relevant to at least two teams apart from your own? If not, maybe a different forum’s better. * Could you use Slack for this?  ### Running the meeting  * Say hi! * Make sure everyone  here. * A volunteer, or failing that, last person in will be the scribe and take notes. Make sure this is locked in. As conversations about the cards on this list happen, scribe will add comments summarizing the conversation. * If there  a card for a daily ritual, do it! That might be going over projects, or sharing things that team members did for you this week, or talking about mistakes. * Go through the cards that people added to discuss. Ask whoever added the card to introduce it and lead that part of the conversation. The scribe will take notes. * If the topic  running long (everyone  time is being used for this, balance communal knowledge and decision making vs being aware of everyone  time), cut it off and suggest moving it out of the meeting. This applies to bravos and woes too. * Nice work. The meeting  over. Archive cards that  do not need to come up next meeting. * Leave the list like you would like to find it. * Choose someone else on the team to be meeting lead next time. Put their face on the meeting lead card, remove yours. * Move any  day of week  back up above the  to discuss . * Put any  day of week  cards that will be relevant to the next meeting under the  to discuss  card. * Enjoy the well run meeting and team communication that just happened.", "idAttachmentCover": "", "members": [], "labels": [], "checklist": [], "comment": [], "attachments": [], "subscribed": true, "checkItems": 0, "checkItemsChecked": 0, "activities": [], "due": "", "createAt": "2021-08-14T06:27:34.356Z", "isDone": false, "doneAt": "", "author": "17" }, { "id": "L3C2", "name": "---Discuss During Next Meeting---", "content": "Put cards below this for items to discuss in our next meeting.", "idAttachmentCover": "", "members": [], "labels": [], "checklist": [], "comment": [], "attachments": [], "subscribed": true, "checkItems": 0, "checkItemsChecked": 0, "activities": [], "due": "", "createAt": "2021-08-14T06:28:14.701Z", "isDone": false, "doneAt": "", "author": "17" }, { "id": "L3C3", "name": "Meeting Lead", "content": "", "idAttachmentCover": "", "members": [], "labels": [], "checklist": [], "comment": [], "attachments": [], "subscribed": true, "checkItems": 0, "checkItemsChecked": 0, "activities": [], "due": "", "createAt": "2021-08-14T06:28:29.662Z", "isDone": false, "doneAt": "", "author": "17" }, { "id": "L3C4", "name": "Product Launch", "content": "", "idAttachmentCover": "", "members": [], "labels": [], "checklist": [], "comment": [], "attachments": [], "subscribed": true, "checkItems": 0, "checkItemsChecked": 0, "activities": [], "due": "", "createAt": "2021-08-14T06:28:41.564Z", "isDone": false, "doneAt": "", "author": "17" }, { "id": "L3C5", "name": "Team bravo", "content": "People are great.
