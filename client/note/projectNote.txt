I. Library:
    1. clsx: use for define className (condition optional)
    ex: className={clsx(classes.drawer, {          // classes.drawer is applied always
            [classes.drawerOpen]: true,              // classes.drawerOpen is applied always, bool = true
            [classes.drawerClose]: !open,            // you can also use boolean variable
            [classes.drawerRed]: colorVar === 'red', // you can also use string variable
        })}
    
II. Setup navigation
    1. Define route in navigationConfig, this file will be used in navigation.reducers.js
        -> converted to redux state for later usage in Navigation.js
